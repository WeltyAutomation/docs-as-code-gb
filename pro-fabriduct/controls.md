## CONTROLS

The operator control console together with the computer touch screen provides a centralized location for the operator to direct the operations of the IOWA PRECISION PRODUCTOMATIC and PRO-FABRIDUCT processing lines.

| _**Note**_ |
| :--- |
| _**A number of the features described in this chapter may not be included in your processing line.**_ _The configuration of the control switches and control system depend on the application specified when the equipment was manufactured._ |

All operators should be familiar with the contents of this section, and have a thorough understanding of the procedures and operating principals covered.

Once the preparation set-up has been completed, the System Control Console is used for system operation and the production run.

### Emergency Stop

The **EMERGENCY STOP** \(**E. STOP**\) push/pull buttons are located around the line and are placed to be within practical reach should an emergency situation occur requiring the immediate shut-down of the system. Some E Stop buttons are lighted.

When the button is pulled or twisted-out the system is functional. When the button is pressed in, it stays in that position, immediately activating all system brakes and stopping all motors in the line. The emergency button\(s\) must be in the _pulled-out_ position for the system to operate. When an emergency button has been activated, the OL TRIP/E STOP lamp on the System Control Console will be illuminate.

| _**Note**_ |
| :--- |
| _All Emergency Stop Buttons must be in the pulled or twisted-out \(deactivated\) position for system operation._ |

### Operator Control Console

The System Control Console is used to select the production run computer program, input the program operational parameters and to engage and control the overall system during the production run. It consists of the system computer, touch screen displays along with the various mechanical buttons, switches and indicator lamps required for overall system control and condition warning.

![Pedestal](../.gitbook/assets/0%20%282%29.jpeg)

Figure 1 - Operator Control Pedestal

Power is applied to the computer and operating system by pulling out on the System Control Pedestal POWER push/pull button. See _Figure 3_. The computer system will perform a system self-test, perform its boot-up procedure, then display the Main Program Screen on the monitor.

### Light Tower

Located on the pedestal is a light tower that is an indicator of active or impending machine functions. This light tower consists of an Amber light, Blue light, and warning horn.

**Length 1-M**

User input. This is the length of the first leg out of the processor or the length of a blank if Blanks is selected in the Duct Type field.

The male lock leg is placed before the first leg on a U-Line configuration and the female lock leg length is placed before the first leg on a Z-Line configuration.

| _**Note**_ |
| :--- |
| _After a numerical value has been Entered, the keypad will stay activated until all numerical fields are entered, or until the cursor reaches a field that does not require a value to be entered._ |

**Length 2-F**

User input. This is the length of the second leg out of the processor. This field is not required for Blanks or 4-Sided duct.

**Duct Type**

This is the type of duct to be produced. To change this field, touch the screen to activate the pull down menu and select the desired duct type. The number of V notches that will be put in the part and the number of bends are determined from the duct type. The type could be **Blanks** when running cut lengths with no notches. The column can also read **4-Sided**, **L-Shape**, **U-Shape** or **Wrap**.

* **Blanks**

Makes parts with no notches or bends. The total length is the number entered in Length 1. _The minimum blank length allowed is 16.00 inches_.

* **4-Sided**

Four sided duct has a lead and trail notch but no V notches and will not be bent. Total part length is Length 1 plus lead and trail size and last leg adder if used.

* **L-Shape**

L shape duct is LENGTH 1 + LENGTH 2 + lead and trail edges. A V notch is punched LENGTH 1 and the brake will bend it to make a LENGTH 1 by LENGTH 2 part and last leg adder if used. The lead and trail punch is made to provide the lead and trail edges for the lock.

* **U-Shape**

U shape duct is LENGTH 1 + LENGTH 2 + LENGTH 1 lead and trail edges and last leg adder if used. A lead and trail notch is punched and a V notches are punched at \(LENGTH 1 and LENGTH 2\). The brake bends the part at these points.

* **Wrap**

Wrap duct is LENGTH 1 + LENGTH 2 + LENGTH 1 + LENGTH 2 + lead and trail edges and last leg adder if used. A V notch is put in at LENGTH 1, LENGTH 2 + LENGTH 1. The BRAKE then puts bends in the part at the points where the V notches were punched.

**Bead/Damp**

* * If your equipment is equipped with a powered bead roll, the operator will need to select whether or not bead will be used on the part. A _**Y**_ means that a bead is needed for the job and an _**N**_ means that no bead is needed. The computer will alert the operator if the last job and the current job have different bead entries.
  * This is for operator information only. An _**N**_ means that a cutout is not required. For a job that requires a cutout in the first leg of the duct blank _**FIRST**_ is selected. For a job that requires a cutout in the second leg of the duct blank _**SECOND**_ is selected.

**Connector**

This is the type of connector being used. To change the connector type, activate the drop down menu and select the desired type. The connector types are:

* **TDC/F**

In this field the operator selects which end\(s\) the cleat will be formed on, _**Right**_ \(Right end only\), _**Left**_ \(Left end only\) or _**Both**_ \(Both ends\).

**Lock**

This is the lock type being used. These are changed by activating the drop down menu and selecting the desired lock type. The lead and trail sizes are setup in the _**Duct Lock Setup**_ Screen _Figure 41_.

Due to mechanical limitations, the lead and trail lock sizes must be equal to or larger than the lead and trail die width. The computer program _will not allow_ lead and trail sizes smaller than the die width to be processed due to limitations of the shear/break combination.

Some examples of Lock Types that _may_ appear are listed below:

* **LrgPitt** \(Large Pittsburgh\)
* **SmlPitt** \(Small Pittsburgh\)
* **Snap** \(Snap Lock\)
* **Raw 1** \(Grease duct with corner seam\)
* **Raw 2** \(Grease duct with split seam\)
* **MM** \(Male/Male\) This selection is not recommended for a ProDuct with a shear/brake combination.
* **FF** \(Female/Female\) This selection is not recommended for a ProDuct with a shear/brake combination.

**Seal/Brake**

* * A _**Y**_ means that sealant is needed for the lock and an _**N**_ means that no sealant is needed. The computer will alert the operator if the last job and the current job have different sealant entries. The sealant manual valves are turned on and off on top of the Mark Rollformer.
  * This tells the computer if the BRAKE is to be used for this job. If _**N**_ is selected, the BRAKE will not bend the part, and parts can pass through the BRAKE. _This does not affect the male bend in the shear/brake_.

**Insulation**

This is the insulation thickness measured in inches. To change the insulation thickness, activate the drop down list and select the desired thickness. The choices are:

* **None**
* **0.5**
* **1.0**
* **1.5**
* **2.0**

A change in pin placement is made if a PINSPOTTER is included.

**Pins**

This is the **maximum** spacing for pin placement for the insulation pins. To change the pin location, activate the pull down menu and select the desired placement. The choices are:

* **0** No pins
* **6″:** Pins placed at most - every 6 inches.
* **7″:** Pins placed at most - every 7 inches.

![0\_SetupPD\_Her\_132](../.gitbook/assets/82.jpeg)

Figure 39 - ProDucto Setup

**ProDuct Settings**

The following settings pertain to the ProDuct.

* * **Offset:** The value entered in this field is the distance from the shear point, which has an offset of 0.000, to the center of a component. A die offset is measured to the center of the die.

The brake and snaplock offsets are negative values due to being in front of the shear. The brake offset is used to establish how much material is being bent and the snaplock offset is used to position the button punches on the male leg.

The Cleat Roller and Bead offsets are positive values. The value entered in these fields is the distance from the shear point \(0.000\) to the point of contact from the cleatroller knock down roll and the upper bead roll respectively.

* * **Adjustment Off:** This field allows the operator to make a positive or negative change to the offset being adjusted. When the field is touched, a keypad will appear. Enter the amount of adjustment, either a positive or negative value, on the keypad. When the enter key is pushed, the offset will be changed by the entered amount.
  * **Dwell:** This field is the amount of time, measured in milliseconds, the valve is turned on to complete the action.
  * **TDC/F Notch Adder:** The value entered in this field is the amount of extra material that will be removed with the lead and trail notchers. This material is removed from the female end of the notch. The overall length of the duct dimension will remain unchanged.
  * **S&D Notch Adder:** The value entered in this field is the extra material that is cut from the female end with the standard lead or trail notch. The main reason for the extra-long notch is to prevent the drive cleat to clear the Mark female forming rolls when a cleat is formed in the ProDuct cleat roller. The overall length of the duct dimension will remain unchanged.
  * **Crop Distance:** The value entered in this field is the distance used by the computer program when the auto backup feature is enabled.
  * **L & T Die Width:** The number entered is the physical die punch width dimension. The computer uses this parameter to make the correct number of punches of the L&T.
  * **Cleat Sub Distance:** This parameter value is used to adjust the distance the knockdown roll is down when forming a drive cleat. The value entered is subtracted the leg length that is going to be cleat formed.

IE, if a 6.00 leg is going to be formed and a value of 0.50 is entered in the Cleat Subtract field, the knock down roll will come up after 5.50. This allows the roll to correctly come down and up on the leg with the drive and not affect the previous or trailing legs of the duct.

* * **Knock Down On Delay:** This time delay, in milliseconds, the control delays the knock down roll to come down for the best position to start the forming of the cleat edge. This function is used with the Cleat Roller offset number for the best result. This feature is used with stand-alone cleatroller.
  * **Knock Down Off Delay:** This time delay, in milliseconds, the control delays the knock down roll to come back up for the best position to stop the forming of the cleat edge. This function is used with the Cleat Roller offset number for the best result. This feature is used with stand-alone cleatroller.
  * **Extractor Length:** This is the length of the longest part that the short part extractor will be extended to assist in pulling the part onto the transfer table from the shear.
  * **Distance To Gate:** The physical distance from the shear cut point to the Mark transfer table pop up gate. The computer uses this length to know how much material can be fed out while the gate is still raised.
  * **Extractor Dwell:** Time the extractor valve is turned on to extend and extract \(grab\) the short part from the shear.
  * **Bead Skip Gap Distance:** This is the distance the bead roll skips beading from certain areas of duct when beading is called for. This parameter is used to prevent beading the areas of the bends and the corner locks of the duct. This should be adjusted for the desired effect. The powered bead roll option is required for this field to be utilized.
  * **Maximum Move &gt; Uncoiler Speed:** The ProDuct feed control uses this parameter to determine the maximum move distance before the ProDuct feeder speed is reduced to equal uncoiler speed.

The reason for this parameter is to allow the ProDuct to move more quickly on short moves usually made during the duct making process. It also helps prevent pulling the metal tight on long moves normally seen when running long blanks.

* * **Maximum Move Error:** The amount of error allowed before corrections are made to target. Increasing this value may allow for quicker targeting, with resulting loss of accuracy. Decreasing this value may cause delayed targeting, with resulting increase in accuracy.
  * **Last Leg Adjuster:** This field is used to increase the length of the last leg of the duct out of the ProDuct.
  * **EZ Hole Distance From Lead:** This parameter value is used to adjust the distance the EZ hole is placed from the lead and trail notch on the lead end of the notch.
  * **EZ Hole Distance From Trail:** This parameter value is used to adjust the distance the EZ hole is placed from the lead and trail notch on the trail end of the notch.
  * **Tie Rod Shift Dwell:** The time, measured in milliseconds, the valve is turned on to shift the tie rods in or out. This is an optional feature.
  * **Notch Shuttle Dwell:** The time, measured in milliseconds, the valve is turned on to shift the notcher dies in or out. This is an optional feature.
  * **Edge Guide Pulse Time: \(Option\)** This parameter is factory set and must not be changed without authorization from Mestek Machinery service department.
  * **Notch Motor Pulse Time: \(Option\)** This parameter is factory set and must not be changed without authorization from Mestek Machinery service department.
  * **Center Motor Pulse Time: \(Option\)** This parameter is factory set and must not be changed without authorization from Mestek Machinery service department.
  * **Edge Guide Reference:** When the powered auto guide set up option is purchased; this is the position count loaded into the encoder position when the adjustable side entry guide is referenced to the home sensor position.
  * **Notch Position Reference:** When the powered auto notcher set up option is purchased; this is the position count loaded into the encoder position when the notcher die assembly is referenced to the home sensor position.
  * **Center Position Reference:** When the powered auto center tie rod option is purchased, this is the position count loaded into the encoder position when the center rod assembly is referenced to the home sensor position.
  * **Scrap Cut Minimum Distance:** The value \(measured in inches\) is the shortest amount of scrap possible with an up cut shear. Do not modify this value as a short scrap cut may get caught in the shear/brake and possibly damage the equipment.
  * **Short Brake Time:** This dwell timer, measured in milliseconds, is used when braking corners in Starter Line with a shear/brake.
  * **Long Brake Time:** This dwell timer, measured in milliseconds, is used when braking the male lock in Starter Line with a shear/brake.
  * **Cutoff With Beam Down:** This feature uses the clamp to hold the material while the shear fires which increases accuracy. To select this feature, touch the down arrow and select **Y**.
  * **Maximum Offset To Material:** This offset is used to determine the distance to material sensor.
  * **Snaplock Backup Distance:** This is the distance the material backs up, after firing the snaplock punches. This helps the material release off the punches better.

**Roll Drive Fields**

The following fields are used to control the ProDuct servo drive system.

* **Acceleration:** This setting controls the rate the servo drive accelerates from a stop to the desired operating speed. This parameter should not be adjusted without consulting the factory service department first.
* **Deceleration:** This setting controls the rate the rolls well decelerate from operating speed to a full stop. This parameter should not be adjusted without consulting the factory service department first.
* **% Run:** The percentage of the maximum speed the machine will run while processing parts. This is typically set at 100 %.
* **% Jog:** This is the percentage of the top speed of the machine that it will run while jogging the machine. This is typically set at 25 %.
* **Desired:** See Auto Scale Procedure in Operation Section of this manual.
* **Actual:** See Auto Scale Procedure in the Operation Section of this manual.
* **Position:** This field is for display only. The value displayed in this field is the amount of material that has been fed through the processor since the last time this counter was reset to zero.
* **Calculated Actual:** This field is for display only. The value displayed is the actual move that was calculated by the computer control.
* **Measure Wheel:** The measure wheel scaling is calculated the same as the servo drive system \(Desired/Actual\) as described above.

Enter 20.000 in the actual and desired fields. Run 5 parts.

After a batch of five 20.000” parts, excluding the crop cut, measure them to the nearest thousandths of an inch. The average of these five measurements is then entered in the **Actual** parameter field, which matches the computer to the mechanical measuring system.

* **Standard/Inverse:** These dropdown lists enable the roll drive and/or measure wheel readout to count up or count down. DO NOT MODIFY these settings as they were set at the factory.

  * Enter the same value \(non-zero\) in the Actual and Desired Distance field on the _Pin Spotter Setup_ screen.
  * Enter a 60.000" 4-Sided part with 0.5" insulation with 12.00" pin spacing on the _Main_ Screen. Turn off the glue pump and do NOT physically load insulation.
  * Run one part off the end of the line and place it on a flat surface.
  * Measure the physical distance from the first row of pins on the sheet to the last row of pins and record this measurement. This is the **actual** distance.

The number of rows will determine which pin location will be used to calculate the desired value.

IF all six rows are placed, use the calculated value \(57.00″\) to calculate the desired distance from the last row to the first row \(57.00″ – 3.00″ = **54.00″**\).

IF only five rows were placed, use the calculated value of \(45.20″\) to calculate the desired distance from the last row to the first row \(45.20″ – 3.00″ = **42.20″**\). This will be the **desired** value.

**Brake Fields**

The following fields are used to control the Brake.

* **Carriage/Home Drive:** This button is used to manually home the brake carriage. When the brake carriage is _homed_, the brake carriage will move to the home proximity switch that is located at the entrance end of the brake and then move back off the switch. Any changes made to the reference position require a homing procedure before taking effect.
* **Enable Carriage:**
  * **Man Mode**
  * **Run Mode**
* **Disabled:** This button is red and brake is disabled.
* **Accel:** This setting controls the rate of carriage acceleration from a stop mode to the desired operating speed.
* **Decel:** This setting controls the rate of carriage deceleration from normal operating speed to a full stop.
* **Home Ref:** This is the location of the gripper arms in relationship to the brake point. As the grippers move towards the beam this number becomes smaller. As the grippers move away from the beam this number becomes larger.
* **Desired:** This setting is a length dimension used to calibrate the length scaler of the brake carriage control to actual mechanical measurement of a machine, usually set to 20.000 inches or more.
* **Actual:** This setting is used when scaling the electronic control measurement to match the actual physical movement of the brake carriage.
* **% Run:** The percentage of the maximum top speed the brake carriage will run when processing parts in auto mode. This is typically set at 100 %.
* **% Jog:** The percentage of the maximum top speed the machine will run when running in manual jog mode. This is typically set at 15–20%.
* **Position:** _Display only_. The encoder position of the Carriage grippers in inches from the bend point.
* **Carriage Arm Up Delay:** The delay time in milliseconds the carriage arms hesitate after a part has passed over the part sensor switch on the rear of the carriage. This is set so the grippers come up about 4 or 5 inches behind the part and move forward until it senses the parts on the gripper hot pins.
* **Carriage Clamp Open Delay:** The delay time to release a part after the carriage has reached the forward target release point.
* **Carriage Parked Position:** The position the carriage parks after finishing a brake cycle.
* **Conveyor Pause Delay:** The amount of time the conveyor stops when the bend cycle is being completed.
* **Leaf Bend Dwell Time:** The amount of time in milliseconds the leaf bend valve is on.
* **Eject Position:** This is a physical dimension beyond the bend point the carriage will move to eject the completed duct. This should always be a negative number.
* **Squaring Time:** This is the amount of time after the part makes contact with the hot pins on the carriage arm grippers until the clamps on the on the carriage arms close. This time is adjusted just high enough to insure the part settles and is not bouncing away. Recommended time, 30–50 milliseconds.
* **Carriage Drive Direction:** A pull down menu selection set up on initialization and installation of the equipment, this parameter should never be modified.
* **Pause Belts For Squaring:** When this button is green, the belts will stop moving once the part is detected at the brake carriage. When the button is red, the belts do not stop.
* **Dual Input Squaring:** This parameter is used to decide what the control needs to look for when squaring the part. The setting is dependent on the type of operation or brake system is used. Do Not Modify this.
